# Competition Registration Status Display - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes and enhances the competition page display to properly show users their registration status, team details, and invitation progress. Currently, users cannot see their registered events and the system shows registration forms even after successful registration. This update will provide a comprehensive view of registration status and team formation progress.

## Glossary

- **Registration Status Display**: The UI component that shows whether a user is registered for a competition
- **Team Details Panel**: Interface showing team information, members, and invitation status
- **Invitation Progress**: Visual indicator of pending, accepted, and rejected team invitations
- **Competition Page**: The main page displaying competition information and registration options
- **User Dashboard**: Personal area showing user's registrations and team memberships
