# Email Verification Update - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This Email Verification Update enhances the existing team registration system by adding an email-based invitation verification process. When a team leader registers for an event and adds team members via email, those team members will receive verification emails with options to accept or reject the invitation. Only accepted invitations will result in team membership, ensuring all team members explicitly consent to participation through email verification.
